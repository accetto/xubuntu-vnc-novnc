***

**Attention!** The repository is **retired** and **archived**. It will not be developed any further and the related images on Docker Hub will not be rebuilt any more. They will phase out and they will be deleted after becoming too old. Please use the newer **third generation** (G3) repository [accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-g3][accetto-ubuntu-vnc-xfce-g3] and the related images on Docker Hub instead. If you still need images based on `Ubuntu 18.04 LTS`, then feel free using the repository for building the images locally.

**Tip** If you want newer images based on [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS][docker-ubuntu] with the latest [TigerVNC][tigervnc-releases]/[noVNC][novnc-releases] versions, please check the **third generation** (G3) [accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-g3][accetto-docker-ubuntu-vnc-xfce-g3], [accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-chromium-g3][accetto-docker-ubuntu-vnc-xfce-chromium-g3] or [accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-firefox-g3][accetto-docker-ubuntu-vnc-xfce-firefox-g3].

**Attention** [Chromium Browser][chromium] in this image runs in `--no-sandbox` mode. You should be aware of the implications. The image is intended for testing and development.

***

This repository contains resources for building Docker images based on [Ubuntu][docker-ubuntu] with [Xfce][xfce] desktop environment, [VNC][tigervnc]/[noVNC][novnc] servers for headless use and the current [Chromium][chromium] web browser.

The images are part of the growing [image hierarchy][this-wiki-image-hierarchy] and they are based on [accetto/xubuntu-vnc-novnc][accetto-docker-xubuntu-vnc-novnc]. They inherit all the features and therefore not the whole description will be repeated here.

The `latest` image inherits among others

- utilities **ping**, **wget**, **zip**, **unzip**, **sudo**, [curl][curl], [git][git] (Ubuntu distribution)
- utility **gdebi** lets  you install local `.deb` packages resolving and installing their dependencies (Ubuntu distribution)
- current version of JSON processor [jq][jq]
- popular text editors [vim][vim] and [nano][nano] (Ubuntu distribution)
- lite but advanced graphical editor [mousepad][mousepad] (Ubuntu distribution)
- [xfce4-screenshooter][screenshooter] and image viewer [ristretto][ristretto] (Ubuntu distribution)
- current version of [tini][tini] as the entry-point initial process (PID 1)

and adds

- current version of [Chromium][chromium] open-source web browser

The history of notable changes is documented in the [CHANGELOG][this-changelog].

### Image tags

The following image tags are regularly maintained and rebuilt:

- `latest` is based on `accetto/xubuntu-vnc-novnc:latest`

    ![badge-VERSION_STICKER_LATEST][badge-VERSION_STICKER_LATEST]

### Dockerfiles

The [Git Hub][this-github-xubuntu-vnc-novnc-chromium] repository contains the following Dockerfiles that can be used to build the images.

- `Dockerfile.chromium`  
  
  This is the main Dockerfile for building the `latest` image tag based on the `accetto/xubuntu-vnc-novnc:latest` tag by default.

  However, by providing the `BASETAG` build argument it is possible to build images based on other base tags, for example `accetto/xubuntu-vnc-novnc:lab`.

### Ports

Following **TCP** ports are exposed:

- **5901** used for access over **VNC**
- **6901** used for access over [noVNC][novnc]

### Volumes

The containers do not create or use any external volumes by default. However, the following folders make good mounting points: `/home/headless/Documents/`, `/home/headless/Downloads/`, `/home/headless/Pictures/`, `/home/headless/Public/`

Both **named volumes** and **bind mounts** can be used. More about volumes can be found in the [Docker documentation][docker-doc] (e.g. [Manage data in Docker][docker-doc-managing-data]).

### Container user accounts

Containers created from these images run under the non-root **default application user** (headless, 1001:0). However, the **sudo** command allows user elevation. For more description check the base image [accetto/xubuntu-vnc-novnc][accetto-docker-xubuntu-vnc-novnc] or [Wiki][this-wiki].

### Version sticker

Version sticker serves multiple purposes that are closer described in [Wiki][this-wiki]. The **version sticker value** identifies the version of the docker image and it is persisted in it when it is built. It is also shown as a badge in the README file.

However, the script `version_sticker.sh` can be used anytime for convenient checking of the current versions of installed applications.

The script is deployed into the startup folder, which is defined by the environment variable `STARTUPDIR` with the default value of `/dockerstartup`.

If the script is executed inside a container without an argument, then it returns the **current version sticker value** of the container. This value is newly calculated and it is based on the current versions of the essential applications in the container.

The **current** version sticker value will differ from the **persisted** value, if any of the included application has been updated to another version.

If the script is called with the argument `-v` (lower case `v`), then it prints out verbose versions of the essential applications that are included in the **version sticker value**.

If it is called with the argument `-V` (upper case `v`), then it prints out verbose versions of some more applications.

Examples can be found in [Wiki][this-wiki].

## Using headless containers

There are two ways, how to use the created headless containers. Please refer to the base image [accetto/xubuntu-vnc-novnc][accetto-docker-xubuntu-vnc-novnc] to learn about them.

Note that the default **VNC user** password is **headless**.

## Issues

If you have found a problem or you just have a question, please check the [Issues][this-issues] and the [Wiki][this-wiki] first. Please do not overlook the closed issues.
